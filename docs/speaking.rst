Speaking Exam Part 2:  Long Turn 
--------------------------------

Task type:	Individual
Time:  		1 minute
Task:  		choose 2 pictures out of 3 to compare


TASK

In this task, you have to talk for about a minute without interruption.  

You are given 3 pictures around a particular theme and you have to compare and react to two of them.

The prompt is also written above the pictures.
You need to compare, contrast, give opinions, speculate and hypothesise, rather than simply describe the pictures.

You are also asked to comment briefly for about 30 seconds after your partner has spoken about his/her pictures.


TASK STRATEGY

Make sure you don’t just describe the pictures
.
Keep talking until the examiner says ‘Thank you’.  Avoid repeating language.

Organise your ideas so that you answer both parts of the question, and try to express yourself coherently and with enthusiasm.

Don’t leave long pauses.  Paraphrase if necessary

When your partner is speaking, listen but you cannot interrupt.  You will have to give a view on what he/she says when they finish talking- the examiner will ask you a short, related question.
